Hypercosm is an open protocol that acts as a 3D analogue of current web technologies. Anyone can run a ‘Cosm’, much
like they can run a web server. There is no central authority or source of truth, just like the World Wide Web. Through
Hypercosm, users can have both single- and multi-user experiences, consume and create media, play games, socialize, and
work.

The protocol is being developed by a group of tech-oriented folks who have primarily been working out of a
[Discord](https://discord.gg/pvgemuz9wb), with plans for more easily-accessible discussion platforms once the protocol
has had an alpha release. Various channels are currently bridged to Matrix:
- Technical Planning (discussions about the core spec, extensions, and other general consensus): [`hypercosm-technical-planning:sleeping.town`](https://matrix.to/#/#hypercosm-technical-planning:sleeping.town)
- Cosm Development (discussions about creating Cosm server software): [`hypercosm-cosm-development:sleeping.town`](https://matrix.to/#/#hypercosm-browser-development:sleeping.town)
- Browser Devlopment (discussions about creating Browsers and other client software): [`hypercosm-browser-development:sleeping-town`](https://matrix.to/#/#hypercosm-browser-development:sleeping.town)
- Shitposting (mostly off-topic discussion and general brainstorming): [`hypercosm-shitposting:sleeping.town`](https://matrix.to/#/#hypercosm-shitposting:sleeping.town)
