Hypercosm is an open protocol that acts as a 3d analogue of current web technologies. Anyone can run a ‘Cosm’, much like they can run a web server. There is no central authority or source of truth, just like the World Wide Web. Through Hypercosm, users can have both single- and multi-user experiences, consume and create media, play games, socialize, and work.
